Each RAVDESS file has a unique filename. The filename consists of seven two-digit numerical identifiers, separated by hyphens (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4). Each two-digit numerical identifier defines the level of a different experimental factor. The identifiers are ordered: Modality–Channel–Emotion–Intensity–Statement–Repetition–Actor.mp4 or .wav. The numerical coding of levels is described in Table 1. For example, the filename “02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4” refers to: Video-only (02)–Speech (01)–Fearful (06)–Intensity normal (01)–Statement “dogs” (02)–First repetition (01)–Twelfth actor, female (12). The gender of the actor is coded by the actor’s number, where odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female.

Filename identifiers

Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).

Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).

Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).

Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the ‘neutral’ emotion.

Statement (01 = “Kids are talking by the door”, 02 = “Dogs are sitting by the door”).

Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).

Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).
